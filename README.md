## The most advanced and modern CSS course on the internet: master flexbox, CSS Grid, responsive design, and so much more.

#### The course is available in Udemy

##### **Important Note**

Node-sass is used in this course which is deprecated so we use different set of commands

> _For installing sass globally in our machine we use_ > **npm intall -g sass**

Since we use scss for developing our project we can do the following steps for debugging and converting scss files to css

> _Create css and scss directory and run the following command_ > **sass --watch scss:css**
